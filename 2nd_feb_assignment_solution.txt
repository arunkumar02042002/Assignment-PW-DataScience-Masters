Q1. When to use a for loop and a while loop?

Ans. We use for-loop when we want to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.) or repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
We use while-loop when we want to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.

Example of for loop:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit, end = " ")
  
#Output: apple banana cherry 
This will iterate over the list of fruits and print each one.

Example of while loop:
i = 0
while i < 5:
  print(i, end = " ")
  i += 1

#Output: 0 1 2 3 4 
This will repeat the block of code until the condition i < 5 is no longer true.

Q2. Write a python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for and while loop.

Ans. Python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for and while loop:

# for loop
sum = 0
product = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
  sum += i
  product *= i
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Product:", product)

# while loop
sum = 0
product = 1
i = 1
while i <= 10:
  sum += i
  product *= i
  i += 1
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Product:", product)

#Output of the both programs:
Sum: 55
Product: 3628800

Q. 3 Create a python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.
The per-unit charges in rupees are as follows: For the first 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 4.5 per
unit, for the next 100 units, the user will be charged Rs. 6 per unit, and for the next 100 units, the user will
be charged Rs. 10 per unit, After 300 units and above the user will be charged Rs. 20 per unit.
You are required to take the units of electricity consumed in a month from the user as input.
Your program must pass this test case: when the unit of electricity consumed by the user in a month is
310, the total electricity bill should be 2250.

Ans.  Python program to compute the electricity bill for a household based on the per-unit charges mentioned in the question:

units = int(input("Enter units consumed: "))
bill = 0

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 4.5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = 100 * 4.5 + (units - 100) * 6
elif units <= 300:
    bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + (units - 200) * 10
else:
    bill = 100 * 4.5 + 100 * 6 + 100 * 10 + (units - 300) * 20

print("Electricity bill: Rs.", bill)
print("Electricity bill rounded-off to nearest integer: Rs. ", int(bill))

#output:
Enter units consumed: 310
Electricity bill: Rs. 2250.0
Electricity bill rounded-off to nearest integer: Rs.  2250

Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100. Use for loop and while loop to calculate the cube of each number and if the cube of that number is divisible by 4 or 5 then append that number in a list and print that list.

Ans. Python program to create a list of numbers from 1 to 100, calculate the cube of each number, and append the number to a list if the cube is divisible by 4 or 5:

#Using a for loop:
numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result = []

for num in numbers:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result.append(num)

print(result)

#Output = [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 95, 96, 98, 100]

#Using a while loop:
numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result = []

i = 0
while i < len(numbers):
    cube = numbers[i] ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result.append(numbers[i])
    i += 1

print(result)
#Output = [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 95, 96, 98, 100]

In both of these programs, a list of numbers from 1 to 100 is created using the range() function. The program then iterates through each number in the list, calculates the cube of the number using the ** operator, and checks if the cube is divisible by 4 or 5 using the % operator. If the cube is divisible by 4 or 5, the number is appended to the result list. Finally, the result list is printed to the console.

Q.5 Write a program to filter count vowels in the below-given string.
string = "I want to become a data scientist"

Ans. Python program to count the number of vowels in the given string:

string = "I want to become a data scientist"
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
count = 0

for char in string:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1

print("Number of vowels in the string:", count)

#output = Number of vowels in the string: 12

The given string is stored in a variable called string, and a string of all the vowels is stored in a variable called vowels. The program then iterates through each character in the string variable using a for loop. For each character in the string, the program checks if it is a vowel by using the in operator to check if the character is present in the vowels string. If the character is a vowel, the program increments the count variable by 1. Finally, the program prints the total count of vowels in the string to the console.
