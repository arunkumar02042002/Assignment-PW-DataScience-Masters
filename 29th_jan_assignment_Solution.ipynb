    "Q.1 Who developed python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and was first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer who worked at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) research center in the Netherlands when he created Python. He named the language after his favorite TV show, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\". Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python for many years before retiring from his role as the \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL) of Python in 2018. Since then, the Python development community has continued to work on and improve the language."

    "Q.2 Which type of programming does python supports?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms. It supports the following programming styles:\n",
    "- Procedural Programming: This is a programming paradigm where the program is written as a series of functions, which are executed one after the other in a sequential manner. Python supports procedural programming.\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This is a programming paradigm where the program is organized around objects and their interactions. Python supports OOP.\n",
    "- Functional Programming: This is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. Python supports functional programming.\n",
    "- Imperative Programming: This is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing how a program operates by changing the program's state. Python supports imperative programming.\n",
    "- Event-Driven Programming: This is a programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events that occur, such as user input or messages from other programs. Python supports event-driven programming.\n",
    "Python's flexibility in supporting multiple programming paradigms makes it a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing."

    "Q. 3 Is python sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language when it comes to identifiers, which include variable names, function names, class names, and other user-defined names.\n",
    "For example, the variable count is different from the variable Count in Python, and if you try to access one as the other, you will get a NameError because Python will treat them as two separate identifiers.\n",
    "Similarly, Python is also sensitive to whitespace (spaces, tabs, and newlines) when dealing with indentation. The correct indentation is crucial in Python to define blocks of code such as function definitions, loop statements, and conditional statements. If the indentation is incorrect, Python will raise an IndentationError.\n",
    "Therefore, it's important to be consistent and careful when naming identifiers and defining indentation in Python programs."

    "\n",
    "Ans. The correct extension of a Python file is .py.\n",

    "When you run the Python program, you can execute it from the command line by typing python my_program.py, assuming that Python is installed and configured on your system.\n",

    "Q.5 Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python code is interpreted. When a Python program is executed, the interpreter reads the source code and converts it into an intermediate bytecode format, which is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of interpreted languages like Python is that the code can be executed on any platform that has a Python interpreter installed, without the need for platform-specific compilation. Interpreted languages are also more flexible and easier to develop with, as changes to the code can be quickly tested and executed without the need for time-consuming compilation."

    "- Extensive standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that includes modules for tasks such as string processing, file I/O, networking, and more, making it easier to accomplish common tasks without having to write additional code.\n",
